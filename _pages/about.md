<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome to my personal website! I am Tinghong Ye (Chinese: Âè∂Â∫≠ÂÆè), a highly motivated and passionate undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I am currently a junior (Class of 2022) with a strong academic record and a deep interest in **Embodied AI**, particularly in **Robotics control and perception algorithms**.

I am passionate about Embodied AI, focusing on building autonomous systems that can intelligently perceive, navigate, and interact with the physical world. My research integrates state-of-the-art techniques in **multi-modal perception, real-time motion planning, and model predictive control (MPC)**. I apply these principles to challenging platforms like quadruped robots, aiming to enhance their autonomy and adaptability in complex, unstructured environments.

- **3D Vision & Scene Understandingüß†**: Construct the SpatialReason benchmark containing multi-hop QA pairs that require complex **spatial perception**, effectively enhance the interpretability of 3D-VQA reasoning paths.

- **Vision-Language Model ApplicationüëÄ**: Built a tactical analysis system based on Vision-Language Models, employing CoT prompting to reason and predict complex sequential actions.

- **Multi-Agent Formation Controlü¶µ**: Designing the experiments of **CLF-CBF-based algorithms** for distributed quadruped robot swarms, optimizing obstacle traversal through hierarchical conflict resolution and dynamic path planning.

- **Sensor-Driven Autonomyüîç**: Enhancing environmental perception via **LiDAR and depth camera fusion**, leveraging LCCP segmentation and RANSAC plane fitting to improve localization accuracy in unstructured scenarios.

- **Real-Time Optimization‚ö°**: Implementing **MPC controllers for 12-DOF quadruped robots**, balancing computational efficiency and motion precision through C++-based matrix operations and ROS integration.

These innovations have been validated in national robotics competitions and contribute to the development of a more capable and adaptable robotic system capable of navigating complex environments.  Pursuing further research in these areas will bridge theoretical advancements with real-world deployability, fostering intelligent robotics that adapt to evolving challenges.
